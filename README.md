# Leaf-area-index-dataset
We propose a dataset that can be used for deep learning alfalfa leaf area estimation and leaf area index prediction. The dataset includes alfalfa leaf area data, leaf area index data, meteorological data, effective accumulated temperature, and soil moisture data collected under different water and nitrogen treatments. In addition, it also includes daily alfalfa leaf area index data simulated using logistic models. Users can download and use data for research purposes for free, simply citing our paper as a data reference. If you have any questions when using this dataset, please contact with imsrobot@outlook.com.
